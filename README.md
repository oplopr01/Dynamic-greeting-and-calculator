in this repo inside the components directory, there are two components one is DynWelMsg and the second is Calculator

DynWelMsg -: contains React code which shows Dynamic message to the user at which time he is visiting the page. if it's morning then welcomed by "Good mourning". if it's noon time then welcomed by "Good afternoon". same as evening time visiting "Good Evening" on screen

Calculator -: contains React code which shows an ordered list of calculation of numbers where values are provided statically (hardcoded data)

via this repo, I am expressing my ReactJS coding skill. this development is mainly focused on programming structure and logic usage designing part is not main focused here
